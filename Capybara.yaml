  keep_gemini:    # A list of hosts where if the host is present; the URL will not be proxied

                  # Example:
                  #   Proxied: `gemini://gem.rest` becomes `/proxy/gem.rest`
                  #   Not proxied (present in `capybara.keep_gemini`): `gemini://gem.rest` is kept

  keep_gemini_exact: # A list of URLs where if the URL is present; the URL will not be proxied
    - fuwn.me/skills #
                     # Similar to `keep_gemini` except only keeps exact URLs
